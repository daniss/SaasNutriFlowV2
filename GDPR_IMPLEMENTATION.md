# GDPR Compliance Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the complete GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliance system implemented in NutriFlow. The system provides both administrative tools for nutritionists and client-facing interfaces for data privacy rights management.

## What is GDPR?

GDPR (RÃ¨glement GÃ©nÃ©ral sur la Protection des DonnÃ©es) is a European regulation that gives individuals control over their personal data. It requires organizations to:

- Obtain explicit consent for data processing
- Allow data subjects to access, correct, and delete their data
- Implement data protection by design
- Report data breaches within 72 hours
- Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) in certain cases

## Implemented Features

### 1. Admin Interface (`/dashboard/settings` - GDPR section)

**Located in:** `components/dashboard/GDPRCompliance.tsx`

**Features:**

- **Consent Management**: View and manage client consents across 5 categories
- **Data Export Requests**: Handle client requests for data downloads
- **Data Deletion Requests**: Process deletion requests with anonymization options
- **Retention Policies**: Configure automatic data deletion based on legal requirements
- **Audit Logs**: Track all GDPR-related activities
- **Real-time Statistics**: Monitor compliance metrics

**Consent Categories:**

1. **Data Processing** - Basic personal and health data processing
2. **Health Data** - Sensitive health information processing
3. **Photos** - Use of client photos for documentation
4. **Marketing** - Marketing communications and newsletters
5. **Data Sharing** - Sharing data with third parties (labs, specialists)

### 2. Client Interface (`/client-portal` - ConfidentialitÃ© tab)

**Located in:** `components/client-portal/ClientGDPRRights.tsx`

**Features:**

- **Mandatory Consent Collection**: First-time visitors must accept required consents before accessing the portal
- **Consent Management**: Clients can view and modify their consent preferences
- **Data Export**: Request a complete export of personal data
- **Data Deletion**: Request account and data deletion
- **Data Retention Info**: View how long data is kept
- **Privacy Rights**: Exercise GDPR rights directly

**Mandatory Consent System:**

- **First Login Protection**: Modal appears on first client portal access
- **Required Consents**: Data processing and health data processing (cannot be skipped)
- **Optional Consents**: Photos, marketing, and data sharing
- **Blocking Modal**: Cannot close or access portal until mandatory consents are given
- **Persistent Check**: Uses localStorage and API validation to ensure consents are maintained

### 3. Database Schema

**Located in:** `scripts/create-gdpr-schema.sql`

**Tables:**

- `consent_records` - Tracks all consent preferences with versions
- `data_retention_policies` - Defines data retention rules
- `data_export_requests` - Manages export/deletion requests
- `data_anonymization_log` - Logs anonymization activities
- `gdpr_audit_log` - Records all GDPR-related actions

### 4. API Endpoints

#### Client APIs

- `POST /api/client-auth/gdpr/consents` - Manage consent preferences
- `POST /api/client-auth/gdpr/export` - Request data export
- `POST /api/client-auth/gdpr/deletion` - Request data deletion

#### Admin APIs

- `POST /api/notifications/gdpr-request` - Send email notifications to admin

#### Notification System

- **Email Service Integration**: Uses existing EmailService with SendGrid/Resend
- **Admin Notifications**: Automatic emails to `contact@nutri-flow.me` for:
  - Data export requests
  - Data deletion requests (marked as urgent)
- **Email Templates**: Professional HTML emails with request details

## Why Consent Records Were Empty Before

The previous implementation only had the admin interface without client-facing consent collection. Clients had no way to provide or manage their consent preferences, which is why all consent records appeared empty.

## New Mandatory Consent System

The new implementation includes a **mandatory consent modal** that appears when clients first access their portal:

### How It Works:

1. **First Visit**: Clients are automatically shown a consent modal upon entering `/client-portal`
2. **Mandatory Consents**: Two consents are required (data processing and health data processing)
3. **Optional Consents**: Three additional consents can be selected (photos, marketing, data sharing)
4. **Blocking Behavior**: Modal cannot be closed or dismissed until mandatory consents are given
5. **Persistent Storage**: Consent status is saved locally and verified with server
6. **Session Management**: Consents are re-checked on each login

### Modal Features:

- **Professional Design**: Clean, accessible interface with clear explanations
- **Visual Indicators**: Mandatory consents clearly marked with red borders and "\*" symbols
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if trying to proceed without required consents
- **GDPR Compliance**: Full GDPR article references and legal basis explanations

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed

1. **Complete GDPR admin interface** with all management tools
2. **Mandatory consent collection** with blocking modal for first-time users
3. **Client-facing consent management** integrated into client portal
4. **Email notification system** for GDPR requests to admin
5. **Database schema** for GDPR compliance
6. **API endpoints** for both admin and client operations
7. **Real-time consent management** with immediate updates
8. **Session protection** ensuring consents are always validated

### ðŸ”„ Needs Configuration

1. **Email Service Setup**: Configure `EMAIL_PROVIDER`, `SENDGRID_API_KEY` or `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variables
2. **Database Migration**: Run the GDPR schema script if not already applied
3. **Legal Review**: Have the consent text and retention policies reviewed by legal counsel

## How It Works

### For Clients

1. **First Visit**: Mandatory consent modal appears (cannot be dismissed)
2. **Required Consents**: Must accept data processing and health data processing
3. **Optional Choices**: Can choose photos, marketing, and data sharing consents
4. **Portal Access**: Only granted after mandatory consents are given
5. **Manage Consent**: Can modify preferences anytime in ConfidentialitÃ© tab
6. **Request Data**: Can request export or deletion with automatic admin notification

### Technical Implementation

The mandatory consent system works through several layers:

**Frontend Protection:**

- `MandatoryConsentModal.tsx`: Non-dismissible modal with consent form
- `ClientPortalContent`: Conditional rendering based on consent status
- `useEffect` hooks: Check consent status on component mount and data load
- `localStorage`: Quick consent status caching with server validation

**Backend Validation:**

- `GET /api/client-auth/gdpr/consents`: Verify current consent status
- `POST /api/client-auth/gdpr/consents`: Save new consent preferences
- Database validation: Ensure mandatory consents exist before portal access

**Session Management:**

- Consent status checked on every login
- `localStorage` cleared on logout to force re-consent if needed
- Server-side consent validation for security

### For Nutritionists

1. **Dashboard Overview**: See all GDPR metrics and pending requests
2. **Process Requests**: Handle export/deletion requests with tools
3. **Monitor Compliance**: Track consent rates and audit activities
4. **Set Policies**: Configure data retention rules

### Email Notifications

When clients make GDPR requests:

1. **Automatic Email** sent to `contact@nutri-flow.me`
2. **Detailed Information** includes client details and request type
3. **Urgency Marking** for deletion requests
4. **HTML Templates** for professional appearance

## Legal Compliance

This implementation provides:

- âœ… **Lawful Basis Tracking** - Records legal basis for each data category
- âœ… **Consent Management** - Granular consent with withdrawal options
- âœ… **Data Subject Rights** - All GDPR rights accessible to clients
- âœ… **Audit Trail** - Complete logging of GDPR activities
- âœ… **Data Retention** - Configurable retention policies
- âœ… **Data Portability** - Export functionality for data portability
- âœ… **Right to Erasure** - Complete deletion with anonymization options

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Email Service** - Set up SendGrid/Resend for notifications
2. **Legal Review** - Review consent text and policies with legal counsel
3. **Staff Training** - Train staff on GDPR processes and tools
4. **Testing** - Test the complete workflow from consent to deletion
5. **Documentation** - Create user guides for both clients and staff
